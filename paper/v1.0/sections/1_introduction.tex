% Section 01 - Introduction

Manipulating light matter interactions in the quantum regime paved the path for an astonishing number of useful technologies in the twentieth century. Quantum optics, which study these interactions, have drawn research attention in the disciplines of optoelectronics \cite{liu16,wijesekara20,tao21}, sensing \cite{rodrigo2015,pirandola18,hapuarachchi2018}, energy harvesting \cite{yuan16,sun18},
quantum computing \cite{huh15,slussarenko19,andersen21}, bio-information \cite{marais18,bian20}, and many other specialities of recent technologies \cite{rivera20}.
The studies on quantum optics of nanostructures were generally centered on metamaterials \cite{shalaev07,si14}, quantum plasmonic effects \cite{hapuarachchi19,perera20}, lasers and amplifiers \cite{zhang05,chow13}, quantum cavity physics \cite{tsang10,devi20}.
However, in recent years, the foremost aim of examining nanostructures under external radiation was for understanding their electron transport characteristics \cite{kitagawa11,zhou11,kibis14,pervishko15,morina15,dehghani15,dini16,wackerl20}.

Better understanding the fundamental mechanisms of charge transport can allow us to invent novel nanoelectronic devices and optimize their performance \cite{premaratne21}.
Among these works, most studies have considered the driving field as a perturbation field \cite{pervishko15,morina15} However, that assumption breaks down for systems under high-intensity illuminations \cite{grifoni98,wackerl20}.
Modeling an electromagnetic field under a perturbative formalism involves expanding the interaction terms in powers of the field intensity. At high intensities, the higher order terms influence the physics more strongly than the lower order terms, and the basis of the perturbative treatment begins to break down.
Then a more accurate and powerful concept needs to be adopted where we treat  the interacting fermion system and the radiation as one combined quantum system (dressed system) \cite{morina15,cohen98,scully01}.

Theoretical analyses of the transport properties of dressed fermion systems were recently reported in Refs. \cite{kibis14,morina15,wackerl20}.
Furthermore, in Ref. \cite{wackerl20} a general expression for Floquet-Drude conductivity has been derived in a fully closed analytical form, introducing a novel type of Green’s functions namely four-times Green’s functions. This established a novel technique to exploit the transport attributes of nanostructures under an intense dressing field.

Quantum Hall effect \cite{girvin90} observed for two-dimensional fermion systems at low temperatures under strong stationary magnetic fields manifest remarkable magneto-transport behaviors. Transport properties of these systems have recently attracted both theoretical \cite{ando72,ando74_1,ando74_2,ando74_3,ando74_4,ando82,endo09} and experimental \cite{allerman95,tieke97,pan05} interest.
Endo \textit{et al.} \cite{endo09} presented the calculations of longitudinal and transverse conductivity tensor components and their relationship in a quantum Hall system. These theoretical calculations better align with experimental observations compared to previous studies. For instance, former studies yield a semi-elliptical broadening for Landau levels and give less fitting interpretations for the empirical results \cite{endo09}.

In contrast, more interesting phenomena can be observed by simultaneously applying a dressing field to a quantum Hall system under a non-oscillating magnetic field.
Whilst there exist several leading theories for calculating conductivity tensor elements in quantum Hall systems \cite{ando74_1,ando82,endo09}, they have not been utilized to describe the optical manipulation of charge transport.
Recently, Dini \textit{et al.} \cite{dini16} have investigated the one-directional conductivity behavior of dressed quantum Hall systems. However, they have not adopted the state-of-the-art model to describe the conductivity in a quantum Hall system. In their study, they used the conductivity models from Refs. \cite{ando74_1,ando82}, and as mentioned in Endo \textit{et al.} work \cite{endo09}, those models yields a semi-elliptical broadening for Landau levels and gives less agreement with experimental results.

In the present analysis, we present robust mathematical model for dressed two-dimensional electron gas(2DEG) subject to another nonoscillating magnetic field.
A stationary magnetic field is applied perpendicularly across the surface of the 2DEG system and the orbital motion of electrons becomes completely quantized. This causes the orbital motion of the electrons to be quantized, and a discrete energy spectrum with Landau splitting is observed \cite{landau30}.
Such a system is known as a two-dimensional quantum Hall system. In this study, we explicitly calculate the longitudinal  ($\sigma^{xx},\sigma^{yy}$) components of the conductivity tensor in periodically driven quantum Hall systems by developing a generalized analytical description to identify transport characteristics of dressed quantum Hall systems using Floquet-Drude conductivity \cite{wackerl20}.
Finally, we demonstrate that our generalized model reproduces the results of
the state-of-the-art conductivity model in Ref. \cite{endo09}, which was developed for the more specific case of quantum Hall systems without the external dressing field.
Moreover, we find that the optical field can be used as a mechanism to regulate transport behavior in numerous two-dimensional nanostructures which can serve as a basis for nanoelectronic devices. We believe that our theoretical analysis and visual depictions of numerical results will lead to a better understanding of manipulating charge transport. Moreover, this will inspire advanced  developments in nanoscale quantum devices.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.  \ref{sec_schrodinger_problem}, we introduce our dressed quantum Hall system and the exact wave function solutions for the given configuration. Sec. \ref{sec_floquet_theory}, provides the Floquet theory interpretation of these wave functions.
We introduce Floquet Fermi golden rule for quantum Hall system in Sec. \ref{sec_inverse_scattering_time}, and we use it in Sec. \ref{sec_floquet_drude_conductivity} to derive analytical expressions for longitudinal components of conductivity.
The derived theoritical model is further analyzed numerically using empirical system parameters and compared with previous studies in Sec. \ref{sec_manipulate_conductivity}, followed by concluding remarks in Sec. \ref{sec_conclusions}.
