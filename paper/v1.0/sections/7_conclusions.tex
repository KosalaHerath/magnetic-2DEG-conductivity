In this analysis, we reported a generalized mathematical model for transport properties in a 2DEG under a stationary magnetic field and a dressing field. With the uniform magnetic field charged particles can only settle in discrete energy values and this leads to the Landau quantization. We modelled the behavior of electrons in Landau levels under the dressing field utilizing Floquet-Drude conductivity method by accounting impurities in the material as Gaussian random scattering potential. Finally, we derived expressions for x-directional and y-directional longitudinal components of electric conductivity tensor for the considering system.

Our derived analytical expressions revealed that the electric conductivity of the dressed quantum Hall system can be controlled by the applied dressing fieldâ€™s intensity. Using detailed numerical calculations with empirical system parameters, we further analyzed the manipulation of conductivity components using the dressing field. We found that the graphical illustrations we gained are capable of produce the same behavior as the experiment conductivity found in quantum Hall systems without a dressing field. Furthermore, we identified that by regulating the intensity of radiation, the conductivity regions near Landau levels can be squeezed. Despite, this behavior has been identified previous works, their results are not coincide with the more accurate description of conductivity components in undressed quantum Hall systems. However, our generalized analysis of conductivity in dressed quantum Hall system provides well-suited description for  these special quantum Hall systems.

In summary, the primary purpose of this paper were to expand the current descriptions on transport properties in dressed quantum Hall systems and our  detailed theoretical analysis shows that we were able to demonstrate that recently introduced Floquet-Drude conductivity model can be adopted to extend the models that are used to describe the transport characteristics in quantum Hall systems. Due to owing the ability of controlling the conductivity regions, high intensity external illumination can be used as a trigger for two-dimentional quantum switching devices which are employed as the building blocks of next generation nanoelectronic devices. Finally, we identified that our findings of this paper can be used towards understanding nanoscale quantum devices, enhancing their performance and inventing novel appliance.
