Interactions between light and matter have dragged research attention in the fields of optoelectronics, sensing, energy harvesting, quantum computing, bio-information, and in many branches of recent technologies. For many years, the foremost aims for examing the characteristics of dressed fermion systems were focused on the different types of atomic and molecular arrangements. These researches of extreme electron-light engagements introduced an astonishing scope of twentieth-century physics namely quantum optic physics.
